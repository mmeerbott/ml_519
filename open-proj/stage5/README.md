# Running the Code
## Preprocessing
To transform the raw data files in datasets, use `transform_data.py`. You can
adjust the data from there. Notice that if you use the method `move_years`, you
will have to fix the header for the output file(s).


# Information
## Preprocessing
Our project required us to gather much data from many sources, and they need
lots of pre-processing (to shape our dataset). Most of our starting code will
be to reshape datasets themselves, and finally combine the data into our
desired format.
